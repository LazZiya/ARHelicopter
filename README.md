# ARHelicopter
AR Helicopter built with Unity3D and Vuforia,

I developed  this sample in 2014 using old versions of Unity and Vuforia just to test the AR and do a "Hello world" project :)

Some code modifications may be required to run with the latest versions of Unity.

However, under [Builds folder](https://github.com/LazZiya/ARHelicopter/tree/master/Builds) you can find the apk files, thay are ready to deploy and test in any android device.

Target images are available under [ImageTargetTextures/Z3D](https://github.com/LazZiya/ARHelicopter/tree/master/Assets/Editor/QCAR/ImageTargetTextures/Z3D), they are in low quality, I will try to find and upload higher quality images, anyhow you are still able to change the target images in the editor.
