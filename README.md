# ARHelicopter
AR Helicopter built with Unity3D and Vuforia,

I developed  this sample in 2014 with old versions of Unity and Vuforia just to test the AR as Hellow world project :)

Some code modifications can be required to adopt it with the new editors.

However, under [Builds folder](https://github.com/LazZiya/ARHelicopter/tree/master/Builds) you can find some apk's that are ready for deployed and test in any android device,
see sample in youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCIRVDrqVfE
Target images are available under [ImageTargetTextures/Z3D](https://github.com/LazZiya/ARHelicopter/tree/master/Assets/Editor/QCAR/ImageTargetTextures/Z3D), the are in low quality, I will try to find and upload higher quality images, anhow, you are still able to change the target images in the editor.
